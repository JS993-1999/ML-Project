# ML Final Semester Project

##PROBLEM DEFINITION & DEFINITION
Over the past few years, business owners and retailers, big or small, have started taking their shops online to increase their reach, promote their brand and increase 
sales that cover a wide range of customers. For these businesses, it is essential to identify the customer base and give them enough rewards and incentives to encourage their online purchase. The primary objective of this project is to identify patterns of the customers that browse a website and make a successful purchase. We intend to achieve this by using various Machine learning techniques and selecting the best classification algorithms that successfully classify the revenue promoting customers from other users using the Online Shoppersâ€™ Purchasing Intention dataset.

## DATASET DISCRIPTION
Of the 12,330 sessions in the dataset, 84.5% (10,422) were negative class samples that did not end with shopping, and the rest (1908) were positive class samples ending with shopping[1]. The dataset was formed so that each session would belong to a different user in a 1-year period to avoid any tendency to a specific campaign, special day, user profile, or period[1].

It contains 10 numerical and 7 categorical columns with the 8th and target column being the target column.
